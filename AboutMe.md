Hey there!  I'm Salsa, a recent grad with a Bachelor and Master in Management, specializing in Human Capital Management (HCM) and Organizational Behavior (OB). While I love understanding the "why" behind people at work, I'm on a quest to unlock even deeper insights with the power of data analytics.

Data analytics and HR might not be the newest duo, but that's what fuels my passion. I've built a solid foundation in both throughout my studies, and recently took an intensive online course to supercharge my data skills.

Now, I'm ready to bridge the gap between these fields and unlock hidden gems that can provide winning business strategies and impactful initiatives, including HR & OB.

This GitHub profile is my data analytics journey.  As a data analytics newbie, I'm constantly learning and growing.  Dive into my projects to see how I tackle data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  Explore how I translate those insights into actionable business solutions, particularly focused on impactful, data-driven HR strategies.

**Let's connect!**  I'm always open to:

- **Feedback**: Help me become a data rockstar!
- **Discuss data-driven HR**: Let's geek out on the future of HR!
If you're looking for a dedicated and innovative professional with a passion for data-driven HR, let's explore how we can achieve great things together!
